# QueroFront

A simple app inspired by [Asana](https://asana.com).

## Functionalities

* Add, Edit and Delete (mark as done) tasks
* Data persistence throught `localStorage`

## JavaScript

Inspired by React, a global object called `$state` is used. `$state` has the list with all tasks and the current (selected) task.


## CSS generated with SASS

Inspired by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a grid system with 12 columns was created. For the vertical aligment of the components, flex-box properties were used.


## External resources

The only external resource used was [SimpleLineIcons](http://simplelineicons.com/).
