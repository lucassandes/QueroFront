# QueroFront

This is a simple app developed for

## Functionalities

* Add, Edit and Delete (mark as done) tasks
* Data persistence throught `localStorage``
* Drag and Drop tasks for re-ordering the list

## JavaScript
Inspired by React, a global object called `$state` is used. `$state` has the list with all tasks and the current (selected) task.



## HTML Markup
The markup was written with HTML semantics in mind. Which means that if something behaves as a button, it has a `button` tag around it :)


## CSS generated with SASS
All the styling was generated with a SASS compiler. The SASS files can be read in the main directory. In the `dist` directory consists only the CSS generated.
